# PL-Statistical-Analysis
This repository contains statistical analysis of players and teams from the English Premier League in the 2023-24 season.

The Premier League is one of the most popular football leagues in the world, and analyzing player statistics from the 2023-24 season provides a structured way to understand football performance. The chosen dataset "premier-player-23-24" found on Kaggle includes information on 580 players from across 20 teams, capturing key performance metrics. The dataset contains both categorical data (such as player names, teams, and nationalities) and quantitative data (such as goals, assists, and expected goals).

Another dataset, "pl_table_2023_24", I found on Kaggle, contains team statistics like league position, total goals scored, total goals conceded, and more. I integrated this dataset with the previous one to capture wider trends.

I've conducted analysis using Python's Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. A detailed report covers all the research questions asked and their respective findings.
